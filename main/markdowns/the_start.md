The plain had just took off and was ascending the newyork  sky. The countless  shining little windows of many towers in the city skylines were like bits of gold spread over the city. Angela was sitting  next to the window on the very front rows of the plain and was staring deeply at the view. It was not the first time she had sat to watch at the bright lights of the city at night, yet this time she was looking at them as if she was trying to find something among them.she sighed and wispered oh, no where can get any close to how nighT looks like here. Hmmm, I,m gonna miss it.

Excuse me, sorry but I couldn't hear you, did you say something, Said the guy sitting next to her. She turned to him and looked at him a few moments with both boredom and curosity. The guy was smiling at him and sitting calm and comfortable in his wide seat with one earphone in his ear on the opposite side of his head. He was middle-aged but still in shape and well dressed and looked keen to chat.
Well, I said I will miss this city" and you definitely heard what I said it's just your lame way of starting a conversation with me! She said it with a sarcastic tone that had some emusement in it. 
The guy erupted with laugh and said "now this time truly sorry! Caught me so guilty! And continued laughing a little bit more. She looked a bit more satisfied and amused.
The man asked were you visiting here? She said, yep, for ten years!
_oh !! And now you're leaving!
she looked at him raise an eyebrow, the man suddenly got out of his surprise, and said with a haste, um I mean how come you leaving? A new job? She said, well yeah I am changing my job. The man looked satisfied with his guess. 
OBVIOUSLY, I will NEED to work a new job when I leave here! ... the man quickly returned to his state of confusion and discomfort. She seemed to be satisfied with playing him, continued, but this is the fate of most people here; it's fun to live here when your in 20s and 30s but not many settle down here reaching 40s. she had that faded smile covered behind a serious face. not clear if she in fact wanted to hide her interest in leading the man. she was clearly giving him the directions he would want, well if he was in fact flirting with him. she seemed to be sure of it, but the guy himself was not so sure.

He seemed to have those hormone rush moments where you clearly want to do something but don't know what. He was staring sharpely at her, and she was not at all uncomfortable about it. He paused a few secs and said, -sorry forgot to introfuce myself, I'm Michale. I'm local here too... - Angela, nice to meet you.
so you live in the city, which part? - upper west side by 90 st - oh really?! you live close to where I lived! she did not seemed surprized - maybe I come visit you next time I'm here! - she said while making a funny face. 
- haha! really? where did you live? - I lived by 97 st. close to ... - hmm very nice area. you know my favorite place there is ...
- That place is bakery! I was never up in the morning to get a breakfast haha, she made a short laugh.
so What takes you to denver, I'd say work, but real question is what kinda work?! she changed the topic abruptly. she did not seem too keen to talk about the city life, well, afterall she was leaving it behind.
I work at a brokerage frim. consulting, mostly. how about you? I mean what brings you to Denver? - I' actually heading to LA, but you know I might stay a night or two in Denver, you know since it's my home town. We actually still have a place there and so many friends, she said it with smirky smile and twitch of the eye. 
- oh yeah?! awesome! you must stay! can you be my local guide?! maybe we could grab a beer together in a local brewery then if you know the city. do you like bear? do you know any good places? he seemed to be both surprizd and satisfied by the way the conversation was headng. Even more so was she satisfied as it seemed she had him in her control quite the way she wanted. 
- Like beer?! hah! can't  live in denever and not like it?! I sure do know places. eveb a few  that I know the owners. 
- Ah Even better! maybe they give us VIP seats.
- [The man continues to play his flirting lines and while she recognizes them she plays along for a while]
- so ... Angela, ..., what takes you to LA? a new job?
  she did not seem very amused by the question. Maybe even abit annoyed. well for one thing, he had already asked it.
  what is with people always obssessing over jobs, why does it matter?  - Nope, mostly for settling! 
- oh yeah?! nice choice, I've been to LA quite a few times, really good place to live and the weather is awesome.
-  really? what is awesome about it? it is always the same? I'd much prefer some place like denver with all the four seasons.
- so if you are from denver and like denver how come you chose LA to settle?! you should stay here!
-  looking at him with an eyebraw up she said - yeah right! well certain people insisted!
-a bit uncomfortable he tried to change the subject. with a bit of rush he asked,  so what do you do for work? -ugh, doctoring! - oh really nice! what kind?! - obgyn. she grows a bit bored and disamuzed.
- oh wow! Nice, a surgent -he seemed to be even more surprized and interested now, mostly because of how the past conversations had been about. 
- on the contrary she was grown to be quite distasted by the conversation going, and was not even trying to keep it going. 
-  you look quite young for a doctor! -why?! I should be older? doctors are all old? old men?! No of course not, I meant just you are young and beautiful it is amazing how accomplished you are ... - ugh! this is just hopeless flirting! first of all I think I mentioned I am reaching to 40s and second, you know nothing what I have or have not accomplished. ... The man seemed quite shocked and 
-  -ughh, I guess I will not stop at Denever this time after all. 
-
